TODOs:
- Now, custom instruments and default ones are intertwined. That is,
if you change something in custom instrument, it will also affect the default value 
of the default instrument. This is because they are both assigned to the same globalRegulator values.
Although InstrumentSettings has a "functions" property for custom functions, 
now we are always setting both the default values in InsSettings and InsSettings.functions.
That means now there's no usage separating them then. In handleApplyInstrument, we also 
interchangeably use the default values and custom values. This is not good.
